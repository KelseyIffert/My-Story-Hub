    <h1>The Last Star on the Horizon</h1>
    <h2>By [Your Name]</h2>

    <p>The gloomy mansion creeped ahead on the giant cliff as we made our way up. We were almost there when Wyatt started having second thoughts.

"I'm scared guys, I think we should turn back." said Wyatt.

"Wyatt, it is going to be okay, we are almost there and then you can tell the older kids that you went to Mr. Hashiri's mansion and stayed the night," said Tobi.

The mansion was bigger than I thought. As we walked up to the door, it creaked open. We walked in, wondering how it opened on its own. I stopped realizing there was someone else coming.

"Wait, chandler is coming too." I said. Chandler came over and smiled, I smiled back while Tobi rolled his eyes.

"Thanks for inviting me to join you." I blushed and turned around to walk back to the house. I was jealous of the bond that Chandler had with my brother. "This is going to be enjoyable." Chandler said.

We all walked into the dusty mansion and started to explore. I took out the flashlights and gave one to each of us. My brothers went one way, while me and Chandler went the other way.

"So, why did you decide to come with us?" I asked.

"I wanted to hang out with you outside of school, and this seemed like the perfect opportunity." Chandler said with a smile. What I didn't know was he was already cursed, and he had to lure us there to get more victims to try and break the curse.

We stopped by a dark room and opened the door; the furniture was covered in sheets and dust. There was a creek as the door closed on its own, eyes wide I distinctly grabbed Chandler's hand but at once regretted it and let go and blushed. His hands felt cold in my warm ones.

"Sorry, I got scared," I said.

"It is okay, I liked it, "said Chandler. He grabbed my hand again and we continued to search the house. We stopped at a closet and tried to open it, but it would not open.

"Let's find something to open it, maybe a crowbar or something." Chandler said.

"Do you think something like that is just lying around?" I asked.

Chandler shrugged and looked around until he said, "I found something."

He used a loose piece of wood, pried it into the closet door, and opened it. Inside were a lot of precious items, like gems, and soon I set my eyes on the gemstone necklace. Inside lay a note. It read, "Anyone who takes my precious items will be cursed for all eternity, you will live a ghostly life, and never ever find love. Beware for anyone lays their eyes upon my beautiful treasure.

"Well, that seems ominous, better not take anything right Chandler, don't want to get cursed." I laughed. I looked over at him as he stared at the jewels. "You don't really want to take something do you?" I asked.

"Just one little coin shouldn't hurt." He said as he went to grab something. Just then a dark shadowy figure popped out of the box.

"You dare touch my treasure?!" shouted the figure. "You will be cursed for eternity. Feast upon the curse of the Hope diamond. I was once a curious child like you, and I took a piece of the treasure and then I got cursed. Just as you have. I must guard this treasure. NOW BEGONE!

And we did, we ran, we screamed, I grabbed my brothers, and we ran home.

Once we got home, I noticed Chandler didn't follow us. At home, I got a letter asking me to meet him at the mansion after school the next day. After school, I decided not to go but that night I looked out my window and there he was. I went outside to meet him.

"I waited but you never showed." Chandler said sadly.

I wanted-" but he cut me off with a kiss and then he disappeared
